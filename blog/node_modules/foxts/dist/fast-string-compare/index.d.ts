/**
 * This is an alternative to `String.prototype.localeCompare`, but way more performant.
 *
 * `String#localeCompare` is slow because it supports internationalization (e.g. `Intl.Collator`).
 * But if you are only working with ASCII-only characters, this function will produce the same result
 * as `String#localeCompare` with en-US settings, but much faster.
 *
 * This function is expected to be used as a sorter callback for `Array#sort`, `Array#toSorted`, and similar functions.
